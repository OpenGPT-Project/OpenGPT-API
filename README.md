# OpenGPT-API
Our official API to use our models and to use some OpenAI Models

At the moment, we do not have our other models on our API but we do have some OpenAI Models that you can test using our API. We are not meant to act as an "OpenAI Proxy" and that is not our goal. Our goal is to provide an API where people can test any and all AI models that are publicly avalible. Now we are not rich so this API has a rate limit of about 1 request per minute. You might start to relize why we only intend for this to be used as a testing API. We will mintor requests to the OpenAI Endpoints and make sure that your inputs breaking OpenAIs TOS.

*We do not log your requests made to the API besides basic webserver logs that may contain your inputs to the AI and your requests to the webserver!*

# Python Wrapper Documention

Now I do not have time to write docs (i am being lazy) but if someone else wants to write docs for the wrapper then they can.

# The API Docs

The offical API Docs is at http://api.opengpt-project.org/ and sorry for no SSL. I will try and get it soon but for now it wont be secure. Again, I am sorry.
